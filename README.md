# Puppy Allergy Tracker

#### Piper (the puppy) has been having some itchiness issues, and this app will hopefully help root out the allergen(s) -- whatever they may be! 

Once a day, my girlfriend will input some information about the pup's day, and "submit" it to storage in a SQLite database. Over time, I'm hoping to tweak the app and the metrics with the end goal of analyzing the data and altering Piper's environment accordingly to remove the allergen.
